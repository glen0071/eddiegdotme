Friend, your cup is full
Thus, I will learn to be brief
I offer one drop

The height of this tree
can draw down more rain upon
seeds and seeds to come

Which tree before me
grew so high it pierced the sky
shedding rain on me

I looked for a cage
Arising without intent
I could not find one

The sun has risen
So it will not set again
We crawl through shadows

Your eyelid’s power:
The sun gives life to the world
Yet it is obscured

The day will come when
Hunger exceeds the harvest
Plant love ev’rywhere

Sit quiet enough
To hear your heartbeat.
Stop reading. Listen.

I can’t find a way
By myself. I can draw maps.
You make a compass.

The sun’s rays bless the
Soil, the rocks, the rose alike
And each is thankful.

Your path to God is
Broader than the horizon.
Step, listen, repeat.

I have never looked
Directly at the sun. The
thought alone pains me.
