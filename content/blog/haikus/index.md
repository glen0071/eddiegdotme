Friend, your cup is full. <br/>
I will learn to be brief. I <br/>
offer but one drop. <br/>

The sun has risen <br/>
to never set again. Still <br/>
we crawl through shadows. <br/>

I have never looked <br/>
directly at the sun. The <br/>
thought of it pains me. <br/>

The sun’s rays warm the <br/>
soil, rock, and rose alike. <br/>
Each is thankful. <br/>

My eyelid’s power: <br/>
The sun gives life to the world, <br/>
yet it is obscured. <br/>

I suffer in my <br/>
remoteness from thee. My most <br/>
chronic delusion. <br/>

I can’t find a way <br/>
by myself. I can draw maps. <br/>
You’ll make a compass. <br/>

The height of this tree <br/>
can draw down more rain upon <br/>
seeds and seeds to come <br/>

Which tree before me <br/>
grew so high it pierced the sky <br/>
shedding rain on me <br/>

The day will come when <br/>
hunger exceeds the harvest. <br/>
Plant love ev’rywhere. <br/>

Sit quiet enough <br/>
To hear your heartbeat. <br/>
Stop reading. Listen. <br/>

Your path to God is <br/>
Broader than the horizon. <br/>
Step, listen, repeat. <br/>
