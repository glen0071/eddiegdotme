Friend, your cup is full <br/>
Thus, I will learn to be brief <br/>
I offer one drop

The height of this tree <br/>
can draw down more rain upon <br/>
seeds and seeds to come

Which tree before me <br/>
grew so high it pierced the sky <br/>
shedding rain on me

I looked for a cage <br/>
Arising without intent <br/>
I could not find one

The sun has risen <br/>
So it will not set again <br/>
We crawl through shadows

Your eyelid’s power: <br/>
The sun gives life to the world <br/>
Yet it is obscured

The day will come when <br/>
Hunger exceeds the harvest <br/>
Plant love ev’rywhere

Sit quiet enough <br/>
To hear your heartbeat. <br/>
Stop reading. Listen.

I can’t find a way <br/>
By myself. I can draw maps. <br/>
You make a compass.

The sun’s rays bless the <br/>
Soil, the rocks, the rose alike <br/>
And each is thankful.

Your path to God is <br/>
Broader than the horizon. <br/>
Step, listen, repeat.

I have never looked <br/>
Directly at the sun. The <br/>
thought alone pains me.
